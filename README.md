INTRODUCTION
This project is my first react native application done in a bid to get hands on experience building React native real life applications.

ABOUT APP
This app is a simple TO-Do list app with an easy to navigate and operate UI which allows Users keep track of their daily tasks. 
There is a simple header section and a content section which contains a text-input box, an add ToDo button and a list of undone tasks
The Text input box allows users to type in their tasks and add them to the list below by pressing the Add To-Do button.
Once added, the tasks are displayed in boxes below which come with a delete icon signifying that the task could easily be deleted by tapping on the box once that particular task has been completed.

Thank You for previewing this app.
